{"body":"# kissy-rails\r\n\r\n[Kissy](https://github.com/kissyteam/kissy) ! For Rails! So great.\r\n\r\nThis gem provides:\r\n\r\n  * [Kissy](https://github.com/kissyteam/kissy) 1.2.0\r\n  * the kissy_ujs adapter\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nApps generated with Rails 3.1 or later include kissy-rails in the Gemfile by default. So just make a new app:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nrails new myapp\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf upgrading from an older version of rails, or for rails 3.0 apps,\r\nadd the kissy-rails gem to your Gemfile.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem \"kissy-rails\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run `bundle install`. The rest of the installation depends on\r\nwhether the asset pipeline is being used.\r\n\r\n### Rails 3.1 or greater (with asset pipeline *enabled*)\r\n\r\nThe kissy and kissy-ujs files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. If they're not already in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` by default, add these lines:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n//= require kissy\r\n//= require kissy_ujs\r\n```\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
